Calculator project

This project we developped with:
- Truffle v5.1.21 (core: 5.1.21)
- Solidity - v0.6.2 (solc-js)
- Node v11.15.0
- Web3.js v1.2.1
- Ganache v2.5.4
- Truffle React box

This project is a simple calcuator with a little memory. You can add, substract, multiply or divide two numbers. You can store a number in the memory associated with the address and add, substract, multiply or divide it with a given number. Also there is a factorial function.

The project is developped with the Truffle React box so there is a frontend where you can interact with the smartontract.
